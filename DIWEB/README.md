# DIWEB - Design of Interfaces Web

Welcome to the repository for the Design of Interfaces Web (DIWEB) course. This journey has been a rollercoaster, from the initial challenges to the incredible ease in design development achieved through diverse and challenging practices.

## About the Course

The first practice was a true test, creating a page for the sale of tickets for the BioPark. It was my initial encounter with Illustrator, and I named my project RealBioPark.
