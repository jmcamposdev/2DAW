# Unit 2 - Sessions & Validations
In this unit we will focus on learning:
- Use of Sessions to persist data during the whole execution and reloads.
- Reloading the same php to show different data.
- Validation of received data to avoid XSS and SQLInjection.
- Validate that the user is logged in to access certain pages.

## Car Store with Login and Sessions - [Demo](https://servidor.jmcampos.dev/2.TareaOnline/1.Coche/)
In this exercise we will do the same as in the previous exercise but we will add a login page to access the budget calculation page.
We restrict access to the budget calculation page if the user is not logged in.

The valid keys are:
- User : `admin` 
- Password : `admin`
